Micro SD module - Test Code
    // The SD example code creates a datalog.txt file for logging sensor data
    // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
    // so you have to close this one before opening another.

// if the file exists in SD card, write sensor data
    if (sdFile) {
    //Write to file
    sdFile.println("ENTER SENSOR DATA HERE");
    // close the file
    sdFile.close();
    // Uncomment to print to the serial port
    //Serial.println("ENTER SENSOR DATA HERE");
    } 
    else {
    // if the file didn't open, print an error
    Serial.println(F("error opening file."));
    }
    }
------------------------------------
 // Set SPI SS pin to output otherwise the SD library functions will not work.
    // The SD is set to use SPI SS Arduino pin 10 as chip select(CS) by default.
    // To change the pin use SD.begin(SD_CS_PIN)
------------------------------------
// There are several different versions of the LCD I2C adapter, each might have a different address.
// Try the given addresses by Un/commenting the following rows until LCD works follow the serial monitor prints. 
// To find your LCD address go to: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner and run example.
#define LCD_ADDRESS 0x3F
//#define LCD_ADDRESS 0x27
